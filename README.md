 Assignment Title

Java Programming Assignment: Classes and Unit Tests

##Assignment Description

This assignment involves creating Java classes with specific methods and constructors, and also requires the implementation of unit tests to validate the functionality of these classes. The primary classes include `Dog` and `Person`. The `Dog` class has attributes for the name and age of a dog, and the `Person` class manages information about a person, potentially linked to a dog. This setup simulates real-world application where objects interact with each other through methods that change their states or throw exceptions based on certain conditions.

##Key Features

1. Dog Class: Handles properties for a dog including name and age.
2. Person Class: Manages a person's information and their association with a dog using Java's Optional class.
3. Exception Handling: Demonstrates handling cases where operations are performed on non-existent objects.
4. Unit Testing: Includes tests for both positive and negative scenarios using JUnit framework.

## Instructions to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 11 or higher.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- JUnit 5 library setup in the project for running unit tests.

### Steps to Compile and Run the Application

1. Clone the Repository: Download the code to your local machine or directly in the IDE.
2. Open the Project: Import the project into your IDE ensuring that it recognizes the Java SDK.
3. Build the Project: Compile the project using the IDE's build functionality.
4. Run the Application: Execute the `Main` class to see the application in action, particularly handling exceptions when operations on non-existent objects are performed.

### Running Unit Tests

- Load the Tests: Open the test directory in the IDE where unit tests are located.
- Execute the Tests: Run the tests using the IDE's built-in test runner which should be configured to use JUnit.
- Review Test Results: Check the output in the test console of the IDE for test results, ensuring all tests pass as expected or reviewing any failures for more insights.

## Additional Notes

Ensure all dependencies are properly configured in your IDE to avoid compilation or runtime errors. The provided code assumes proper setup of JDK and JUnit library.
